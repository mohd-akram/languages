Language Graph
==============

**[Live demo](https://git.io/languages)**

This project shows a graph where the nodes are programming languages
and the edges are compilers. The graph is drawn using [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org),
particularly the [CoSE layout module](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js-cose-bilkent).

The data for the list of compilers is sourced from the
[compilers.js](https://github.com/mohd-akram/compilers) module.
Please submit any data updates to that repository.
